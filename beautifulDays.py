Lily likes to play games with integers. She has created a new game where she determines the difference between a number and its reverse. For instance, given the number , its reverse is . Their difference is . The number  reversed is , and their difference is .

She decides to apply her game to decision making. She will look at a numbered range of days and will only go to a movie on a beautiful day.

Given a range of numbered days,  and a number , determine the number of days in the range that are beautiful. Beautiful numbers are defined as numbers where  is evenly divisible by . If a day's value is a beautiful number, it is a beautiful day. Return the number of beautiful days in the range.
